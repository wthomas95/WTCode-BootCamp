    <h1>Past and Future</h1>
    
    <h2>Where I've been</h2>
    <p> I moved to Augusta in 2012, coming from New Mexico. My dad was in the military, so I lived all around the world growing up.</p>
    <p class="p1"> I graduated from Aquinas High School in 2014, and took some college courses at Augusta University before deciding to pursue a web development certification</p>
    
    <h2>Where I hope to go</h2>
    <p>I hope to get certified as a junior web developer, and to begin a career in the programming field</p>
    


    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>I'm a fairly introverted person, so many of my interests involve things that I can do by myself, although almost everything can be improved with the right company!</p>
